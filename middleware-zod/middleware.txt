In case of real world its used to do pre checks like authentication e.g checking if someone is logged in and username along
with the input validation. Basically in case of the hospital example someone should conduct tests beforehand

app.use -> any routes coming after it has been declared over there u dont have to specifically call the middleware as a callback
in your functions list
